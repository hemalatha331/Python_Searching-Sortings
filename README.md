# Algorithms Repository

This repository contains Python implementations of common searching and sorting algorithms. Each file represents a different algorithm, demonstrating both the method and structure for solving common computational problems.

## Algorithms Included

### 1. **binary_search.py**
   - A Python implementation of the **Binary Search** algorithm.
   - **Binary Search** finds the position of a target value within a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

### 2. **bubble_sort.py**
   - A Python implementation of the **Bubble Sort** algorithm.
   - **Bubble Sort** compares adjacent elements in an array and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It continues this process until the array is sorted.

### 3. **insertion_sort.py**
   - A Python implementation of the **Insertion Sort** algorithm.
   - **Insertion Sort** builds the sorted array one element at a time by repeatedly picking the next element and inserting it into the correct position in the sorted portion of the array.

### 4. **linear_search.py**
   - A Python implementation of the **Linear Search** algorithm.
   - **Linear Search** sequentially checks each element of a list until the target value is found or the list is exhausted.

### 5. **merge_sort.py**
   - A Python implementation of the **Merge Sort** algorithm.
   - **Merge Sort** divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves back together.

### 6. **selection_sort.py**
   - A Python implementation of the **Selection Sort** algorithm.
   - **Selection Sort** repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion and moves it to the sorted portion.
